A hypertextual narrative adventure
<br>Kill Bill: Vol 1
<br>Scene: Showdown at the House of Blue Leaves
<br>Read the README.txt for instructions
<br>Click index.html to start

## Instructions ##

<br>

1) Everything must be downloaded and contained in the Kill Bill Project folder. If you are reading this, then this
step was most likely done correctly already.

<br>

2) To play the hypertext, double click index.html

<br>

3) The home page will appear. You will see a START button. All of the buttons that navigate to another page
will be in the same format, they will look like this one. 

<br>

4) If you click START the first page appears. You will see a blank space bordered with a white line among the 
words. If you hover your mouse over these blank spaces a word appears. These are also clickable and they will
play sounds. 
	-Some of these words are Japanese, this is meant to provide a learning factor in listening intently.
		-For example, try to figure out what a shirasaya is by the sound instead of google.
	-Note there is one button labelled RAGE that isn't blank, click this for a video.
  
  <br>

5) Later on you will encounter play buttons, these are clickable and play music. It is encouraged to press these 
as you arrive on them while reading.

<br>

6) Lastly, have fun dueling O'Ren!
