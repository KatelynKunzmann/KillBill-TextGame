      <div>
          You feel resistance against your blade as you spin.
          <br> O'Ren staggers away from you holding her leg.
          <br> You feel relief as now the playing field is even.
          <br> You gaze into her eyes with a striking confidence.
          <br> O'Ren speaks with a scared, but serious tone. "For ridiculing you earlier..."
          <br> "I apologize"
          <br> You reply, "Accepted....Ready?"
          <br> O'Ren: "Come on"
          </div>
          <div>
              Your hanzo and her hanzo <button
              class = "textButton"
              onclick="playAudio('hanzomeets')">meet</button> with slow, but firm strength.
          </div>
          <div>
              You try your spin move again, but this time with quick and undeniable strength!
              <br> Your blade cut through something like butter.
              <br> O'Ren: "That really was a Hattori Hanzo sword."
              <div
                class="choice_container"
                id="win"

    <span class="musicButton">&#9654;</span>
    </div>
              <br> You hear her fall to the ground. You begin to peer over your shoulder.
              <br> In your peripheral, you see her scalp and her body separated.
              <br> Your head jerks back. She's dead. You walk to the koi pond and sit down.
          </div>
          <br> You cross O'Ren Ishii off your list
      </div>
