README for Kill Bill: Vol 1 project

Instructions:

1) Everything must be downloaded and contained in the Kill Bill Project folder. If you are reading this, then this
step was most likely done correctly already.

2) To play the hypertext, double click index.html

3) The home page will appear. You will see a START button. All of the buttons that navigate to another page
will be in the same format, they will look like this one. 

4) If you click START the first page appears. You will see a blank space bordered with a white line among the 
words. If you hover your mouse over these blank spaces a word appears. These are also clickable and they will
play sounds. 
	-Some of these words are Japanese, this is meant to provide a learning factor in listening intently.
		-For example, try to figure out what a shirasaya is by the sound instead of google.
	-Note there is one button labelled RAGE that isn't blank, click this for a video.

5) Later on you will encounter play buttons, these are clickable and play music. It is encouraged to press these 
as you arrive on them while reading.

6) Lastly, have fun dueling O'Ren!
